\chapter*{\centering Abstract}
Strut network solvers are an essential tool in design and engineering. This thesis covers the implementation of a solver using exact matrices with coefficients dependant on member coefficients $\varepsilon$ modeling stiffening and weakening due to normal force in Python.

The language Python was used because it supports multiple paradigms, has a well developed ecosystem of modules and packages and is widely used in the open source software community.

The CSV format for input and output makes it possible to edit using a spreadsheet program and be parsed or generated by other programs.
A program could be used to generate a structure, call the solver and read back the results to adjust parameters, allowing for an iterative design process.

A selection of three different load Types was chosen and implemented in such a way that makes it easy to extend. A single force acting on a strut, a torque and a trapezoid allowing to specify triangle and constant loads.

Four strut types were implemented. Both joints rigid, left or right joint pin-jointed and both joints pin-jointed.

The system geometry, loads and resultants were visualized using \textit{matplotlib}. To draw the deflection plot cubic B\'{e}zier curves were used.

This program could be extended in many ways improving memory-usage, CPU time and usability but also to perform more advanced analysis, some of which are proposed in the last chapter.

\chapter*{\centering Acknowledgements}

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Prof. Marcus Aberle. He consistently allowed this paper to be my own work, but steered me in the right direction.

I would also like to acknowledge Prof. Dr.-Ing. Markus Baumann as a great mentor and his continuous encouragement in my studies at Hochschule Karlsruhe, University Of Applied Sciences.

I am also grateful to Prof. Dr.-Ing. Robert Pawlowski, lecturer, in the department of Timber Structures, Design and Construction. I am extremely thankful and indebted to him for sharing expertise, and sincere and valuable guidance and encouragement extended to me.

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and to my friends for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.

And last, but by no means least, I would like thank my friend and roommate Jan Kr\"uger for his support, his insights and for having been there when it mattered most.

Thank you.
